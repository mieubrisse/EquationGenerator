- Make multiplication and division format prettier
- Add ability to format output equation in LaTeX format
- Add scaling to the constants that are generated for an operation
- Add exp, log, sin, cos, tan
- Change the way complexity works - pick how many of which subset of operations will be applied
- Cache results of factor-finding, so it doesn't have to be redone
- Allow recursive expression-making -- represent constants as an expression

DONE
- Change addition to use subtraction notation when adding negative number
